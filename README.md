# Investigating the Dynamics of Water with Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations

This notebook was designed for the final project of an upper level Condensed Matter Physics course taught at Bryn Mawr College. It was inspired by the Making It Rain Project (Arantes P.R., Depólo Polêto M., Pedebos C., Ligabue-Braun R. Making it rain: cloud-based molecular simulations for everyone. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 2021. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00998. https://github.com/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain).
